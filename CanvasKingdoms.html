            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                This game has fairly standard platformer controls.
                The player will enter paintings and be transported to the worlds they see depicted.
                From there, they must jump across a series of platforms and obstacles
                to collect lost paintbrushes, pigments, or pieces of her own artwork.
                The princess uses what she finds to complete paintings,
                revealing new areas in the castle, maybe even a way out!

    <section class="feature">
        <h4>Coyote Time &amp; Jump Buffering</h4>
        <p>Coyote time: allow a short window to jump after leaving a platform. Jump buffering: queue a jump pressed slightly before landing to execute on touchdown.</p>

        <!-- DESIGN OVERVIEW -->
        <article class="section-block">
            <h3>Design Overview</h3>
            <p>Inspired by disney movies and old cgi barbie movies,
                players will explore fantastical fantasy locations,
                each inspired by iconic fairy tale stories. The castle is dark and oppressive,
                while the paintings are vibrant and surreal, creating a stark contrast.
                Each painting is a unique, self-contained world with its own art style, physics,
                and platforming challenges</p>

        <!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->
        <article class="section-block">
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>This game was my first unity game, as well as my first game using 3D! I spent alot of time
            getting to know how the unity physics engine works, as well as how to take some control back from it
            for satisfying gameplay. during development my goal was to make my code as reusable as possible,
            which taught me a new way of thinking while I was developing the game</p>
