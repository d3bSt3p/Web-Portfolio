            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Inferno is a challenging 2D, side-scrolling, action        	platformer that pits the player against the legions of Hell.

                Following Dante’s Inferno, the netherworld is a mix of Greek, Roman, and Abrahamic mythologies. You have not practiced sin nor virtue while alive. Whether burdened by regret, guilt, or external circumstance, you simply coast through life, ignoring what it meant to live. Consequently, in death, you are ignored, tossed into Limbo and beneath the waters of the Styx to be eternally forgotten. It is from this darkness where you must escape and journey through the 9 circles of Hell to acquire a second chance at life.

                The challenge within the game is shared between platforming and combat encounters. Initially equipped with a sword of flame, traverse through each level unlocking more combat and movement abilities as you progress deeper through Hell. Battle enemies, learning their mechanics, so that they’ll no longer hinder and potentially aid you on the treacherous path. With enemy variety and platform mechanics tied to their respective circle of Hell, a cast of sinners and demons to meet throughout the journey, and boss fights / gatekeepers placed every 3 layers, the player will be constantly presented with new challenges and gameplay to interact with.

                Blending action platforming with a horror setting, Inferno has the player constantly feeling a sense of unease and danger tempered by a sense of accomplishment in overcoming a challenge. Following the themes of the story, the game tests the players’ ambition and how far it will take them.

        <!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->
        <article class="section-block">
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>First large project with a large team. Learning to clearly communicate ideas, and have clean and readable code
                was essensial for sucsess. Spent alot of time working on the design document, and making it readable and maintainable.
                First project I used github for. Studied old school castlevania games.
                check out our teams postmortem!
